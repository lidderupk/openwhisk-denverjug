# Dive into Java serverless with Apache Openwhisk (Denver JUG)

## Presentation at Colo Spgs Open Source Meetup
Lets dive into Serverless concepts including Actions and Triggers on the OpenWhisk Serverless open source platform. We will use the wsk command-line tool to create and organize Java functions in packages that can be run on demand. Apache OpenWhisk (Incubating) is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications.
